<!--
Hi!

Good afternoon, and greetings to everyone attended our session here.

In today's session, me, Fanshi Zhang, with another amazing software engineer Kebe Liu here will be presenting our work on some of the works we have done so far on distributed training of AI and workloads.

But, don't worry if you are not familiar with machine learning or distributed training , we will get you covered when introducing the concepts.

Surely we now understand what model is and what was doing during training. There comes challenges.

[click] In modern days, models are getting larger and larger, [click] they wouldn't be able to fit into a single instance of GPU. Therefore, to deal with the "too large" problem, [click] we will need to distribute them to multiple GPU clusters.

Ok, everything seems fine. More GPUs means faster training, right? Or is it?

[click] It turns out the memory and power consumption will not be the only problems we will face, but also the failures.

Hmm, so where is the so called "Irreversible" issues?

Sorry to spent so many slides to build up the fundamental. You have done well!

Please allow me to explain how distributed training works in PyTorch with one additional slide.

Ok...

[click] Instead of a normal deployment, distributed training jobs are more like a StatefulSet.

[click] When bootstrapping, the main node (rank 0) will be the first to start, [click] then negotiate with other nodes (rank != 0) to join the training through NCCL.

While both [click] calculate topology, [click] calculate connectivity, [click] calculate bandwidth, etc.

[click] Once everyone is ready, minibatch will be calculated and sent to each node.

[click] During training, every step, or epoch, a Ring AllReduce or AllReduce operation will be performed across the nodes.

That's so many words!

Don't worry, Relax, let's simulate one interactively.

Let's look the overview first.

[click] Say we have a distributed training job running on a GPU cluster, [click] pay attentions to how the error is propagated from one node to another...

[click] For giving nodes in cluster that running distributed training workloads. [click] the main node (rank 0) will be the first to start, then negotiate with other nodes (rank != 0) to join the training through NCCL.

[click] Once everything is ready, the training will be started across the nodes.

[click] However...... What if one of the node (or pod) encountered some critical issues due to NCCL, or GPU failures?

[click] That's the most interesting part, see the propagation of the error from one node to another?

Kind of way to abstracted, here's the explanation.

That means, when one of the node failed, for NCCL based distributed training, since every node requires the others to continuously communicating, when it comes to the case where the NCCL is hanging, well, nothing gets done, right? Every one is basically sit there and keep waiting.

How can we resolve this issue?

Sure it it able to kill the ALL related nodes (or pods) and restart. But it's obviously, there must be something wrong.

Where went wrong?

First, [click] the distributed algorithm is purely implemented by PyTorch, or NCCL itself. It's hard to debug, trace, make it managed, and controlled.

Second, [click] unlike nowadays Kubernetes Operators, healing, orchestrating still hard to achieve. It's hard to auto-heal, auto-recover, auto-mitigate. Obviously, we have no ways to detect what's happening.

Third, [click] detecting failures of drivers, hardwares, GPUs, or even network is still a challenge. It's hard to

- know the root cause
- collect needed NPD events & logs
- and there is the lack support of observability.

Things didn't stop there. There is actually more.

Remember how the node (or pod) went wrong? When we recovering the training job, simply restart them and have pods scheduled to another health node isn't sufficient.

[click] Checkpoint files must be transferred too!

However...

[click] Checkpoints are large. For example, Llama 2 has roughly 83GB of checkpoint files.

[click] The Limited bandwidth of NFS, shared Volumes, RDMA. Saving 80G and above levels checkpoint files require high speed of IO to reduce the downtime.

[click] Mitigation requires transferring across nodes. If one of the GPU node went down, hundreds GB of files must be transferred to another node.

With that words, we could say: IO, and storage are other challenges we need to face.

<!--
Who else have tried to solve the issues? Clearly everyone understand the challenges now. There are two projects we found that solved the problems from two different perspectives.

[click] One of it, is JobSet, [click] a Kubernetes SIG project. It's easily to extend, however, it

- cannot handle events from pods
- and log analysis
- and cannot perform periodic inspection.

[click] DLRover, [click] a trainer-oriented project. It's PyTorch native, ready to use out of box, however, it

- cannot perform periodic inspection
- and not extensible to various of frameworks & scenarios since it's built for PyTorch, as a extended trainer.

There are some of the [click] arxiv papers that you can read to understand more about the [click] researches. I've put them here for your reference.

<!--
Let’s dive into the core features of kcover.

[click] Firstly, there is the “Firewatch of Workloads.” This feature will continuously monitor the status of training job workloads, such as PyTorchJobs, and promptly detect any error messages.

[click] Next, “Enhanced Observability” will be implemented by utilizing various means to determine the status of jobs, such as observing logs and real-time system calls, thus enhancing the observability of training jobs.

[click] Through “Periodic Inspection,” we will regularly test the status of jobs, the environment, or infrastructure to ensure that the resources committed to training jobs meet the required conditions, ensuring smooth training progress.

[click] With “Cascading Shutdown,” when a fault occurs that prevents the training job from continuing, the entire job will be restarted through Cascading Shutdown. This prevents the training framework from waiting due to a non-working part, thus avoiding the waste of valuable hardware resources.

[click] Finally, “Intelli-Migration” will intelligently assess the health status of nodes to determine whether they can continue running jobs, ensuring maximized resource utilization while safeguarding training efficiency.

<!--
The architecture of Kcover consists of two parts: Collector and Controller (also known as Recovery Manager).

The Collector runs as a Daemonset on each Node, responsible for gathering information. This includes executing the dcgmi command, analyzing the logs and events of each Pod, and invoking some system calls, such as checking the status of PCIE devices, to determine the operational status of jobs. It reports any exceptional events back to the APIServer.

The Controller keeps an eye on events relayed by the APIServer and further analyzes the data gathered by the Collector. Based on this analysis, it decides if a Job needs to be restarted. If a restart is  necessary, the Controller will reboot the entire Job and may also mark the node as unschedulable to prevent further assignments.

[click] Once a training job is labeled, kcover will continuously analyze this information.
This includes [click] node status, [click] container logs (such as CUDA, NCCL, or OOM errors, [click] as well as specific exit codes).
[click] If a problem is detected,
[click] we will record the event through the Collector [click] and may initiate a Cascading Shutdown to restart the job, allowing it to resume training from the last known state. [click] Additionally, through ongoing diagnostic tools, we will analyze [click] network status, [click] GPU hardware status, [click] PCIE status, and [click] kernel status to ensure that the system always operates at optimal conditions.

# How to use it?

<span>Easy. simple, two commands</span>

#### Install

```shell {|3}
helm repo add baizeai https://baizeai.github.io/charts
helm repo update baizeai
helm -n kcover-system --create-namespace install kcover baizeai/kcover
```

<div mt-6 />

<div v-click>

#### Label the should watched resources - With `kubectl`

```shell
kubectl label pytorchjobs pytorchjob-example kcover.io/cascading-recovery=true
```

</div>

<div mt-6 />

<div v-click>

#### Label the should watched resources - With `yaml`

```yaml {6}
apiVersion: kubeflow.org/v1
kind: PyTorchJob
metadata:
  name: pytorchjob-example
  labels:
    kcover.io/cascading-recovery: "true"
  # ...
```

</div>

<!--
To start using kcover, you can initially install kcover onto your system with a few simple helm commands.

[click] You only need to execute the helm install command to install kcover on your cluster.

[click] Subsequently, when submitting training jobs, such as a PyTorchJob, you only need to set a label for the job.

[click] This allows kcover to continuously monitor the job, ensuring that it can be quickly recovered after a failure without the need for manual intervention.

We couldn't make it without any of the communties. We wanted to shout out to the community for the following improvements to discuss with.

This is the list of it.

- [click] We want to propose to have a universal trainer health check implementation for PyTorch, as well as other frameowrks, trainers.
- [click] Maybe, we could together to build better analysis and root cause debugging on top of Kubernetes.
- [click] And even, ask for frameworks to try to expose more observability metrics for tracing, logging, and monitoring. Instead of just tensorboard. For example, with Prometheus metrics and OpenTelemetry.
- [click] Finally, how about implementing a stateless negotiator layer on top of TensorFlow, PyTorch, and Jax? So we can extend it like Kubernetes scheduler plugin.
